## About me 👋 
Hello there, I'm Theodor! Currently, I'm an 11th grade high school student in Germany. Since I enjoy programming, playing video games as well as artistically expressing myself, I combined those three together and started learning how to program video games – starting at my first scratch games in elementary school, I've come a long way, with me currently looking to make my first rudimentary game engine in C++ and OpenGL. For the future, I'm planning to study computer science at the Technical University of Munich.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason, just DM me on Discord ("\_frbfstudios_" or use the link on my profile) or send me an E-Mail – I'm open for anything :)
