# Hi, I'm Theodor!
Hello there, I'm Theodor! Currently, I'm an 11th grade high school student in Germany. Since I enjoy programming, playing video games as well as artistically expressing myself, I combined those three together and started learning how to program video games. Starting from Scratch (literally), I'm now looking to create a game engine in C++ and OpenGL. For the future, my plan is to study computer science at the Technical University of Munich.<br/><br/>
Aside from coding, I also like making videos on my YouTube channel. They're mostly gaming videos and uploads have recently been scarce, but I've also uploaded some of my newer Blender animations.

## Contact me
If you want to hit me up for whatever reason, just DM me on Discord or send me an EMail – I'm open for anything :) You can also check out my YouTube channel.
