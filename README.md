## About me
Hello there, I'm Theodor! Currently, I'm an 11th grade high school student in Germany. Since I enjoy programming, playing video games as well as artistically expressing myself, I combined those three together and started learning how to program video games – starting at my first scratch games in elementary school, I've come a long way, with me currently looking to make my first rudimentary game engine in C++ and OpenGL. For the future, I'm planning to study computer science at the Technical University of Munich.
Aside from programming, I like making videos on my YouTube channel (link on my profile). They're mostly gaming videos, but I have also been using Blender to make occasional animations for the past few years, some of which I have uploaded on YouTube as well.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason, just DM me on Discord ("\_frbfstudios_" or use the link on my profile) or send me an E-Mail – I'm open for anything :)
